<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for e-open House 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><u>Primary One Registration Info:</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>I would still like to register in-person at the school. Can I do so?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>From this year, registration for all phrases, Phase 1 to 2C Supplementary,
will be through the P1 Registration Portal or FormSG. You may view your
child’s eligible registration phases and schools from 9am on Tuesday, 2
July 2024 and register your child during their eligible phases. Registration
outcome will be available on the results announcement days and you will
also be notified of the results through SMS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details can be found at the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Go to Primary One Registration webpage</u></a>
</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p><strong>What address can be used for registering my child in the P1 Registration Exercise?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The address to be used is the official residential address as reflected
on the parents’ NRIC. If the addresses on both parents’ NRICs are different,
parents should decide on the address to be used for registration. This
address will be used to determine the Home-School Distance category. If
the child gains priority admission under the Home-School Distance category,
you will have to reside at the address used for registration for at least
30 months from the start of the P1 Registration Exercise <strong>on 2 July 2024</strong>.
If this condition is subsequently not met, MOE reserves the right to transfer
the child out of the school to another school.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>How do I go about making the alternative child-care arrangement declaration?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents who wish to register their child using the address of the child’s
grandparent or the parent’s sibling (i.e. a caregiver), should declare
the alternative child-care arrangement by completing an online form, instead
of submitting their declaration physically at MOE’s Customer Service Centre.
<br>
<br>One parent is required to submit the online declaration form, and upload
relevant supporting documents. The form will be available from <strong>9 am on Monday, 1 July 2024 to 4pm on Thursday, 1 Aug 2024. </strong>Parents,
who require making the declaration, are encouraged to do so early and allow
at least 3 working days for the application to be processed.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>What is the Primary One Registration Portal? Who can register for Primary 1 using the P1 Registration Exercise?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;P1 Registration Portal is an online system for parents to register
their children [Singapore Citizen (SC)/ Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR)]
in primary schools during Phase 1 to 2C Supplementary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should use portal if you meet all the following requirements:
<br>- Your child is eligible for registration in Phase 1 to Phase 2C Supplementary.
<br>- Your child's birth is registered in Singapore and the child holds a
Singapore-issued Birth Certificate.</p>
<p>- Only one of the parents has valid SingPass with 2-Step&nbsp;Verification
(2FA) setup. You are required to declare that you have sought consent from
the other parent to register your child for P1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the P1 Registration Portal, you will be directed to register via an
online form if:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have a child due for P1 registration,
whose name is not shown in the portal.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your child is eligible for a phase
or school that is not reflected in the portal.</p>

<p><strong>My Child is not a Singapore Citizen or Singapore PR and is born between 2 Jan 2018 and 1 Jan 2019. How can my child seek admission to Primary One (P1) in 2024?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
</p>
<p>Non-Singapore Citizen (SC) / non-Permanent Resident (PR) children who
wish to seek admission to P1 in 2024 are required to undergo a two-step
process:</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Step 1</strong>: Submit an online ‘indication of interest’ form
via the MOE P1 website, <strong>from 9am on Tuesday, 28 May 2024 to 4.30pm on Monday 3 Jun 2024.</strong> Those
who do not do so <strong>by 3 June 2024</strong> will not be able to register
during Phase 3 of the P1 Registration Exercise.
<br>
<br><strong>Step 2</strong>: In Oct 2024, MOE HQ will notify parents who have
indicated their interest via email on whether their non-SC / non-PR child
can be offered a P1 place. For non-SC / non-PR children offered a place,
the parent will be informed of how to register with the designated school.
<br>
<br>Parents of non-SC / non-PR children should note that the 'indication of
interest' is not considered as registration. Parents of non-SC / non-PR
children should also note that&nbsp;admission is not guaranteed&nbsp;as
there are limited vacancies remaining for non-SC / non-PR children after
places are allocated to SC/PR children.
<br>
<br>As admission is not guaranteed, parents are advised to consider alternative
educational options well ahead of time.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Punggol View Primary is one of the seven new primary schools that took
in students from 2013. As recommended by the Primary Education Review and
Implementation (PERI) Committee, the school has new design norms such as
redesigned classrooms, dance and performing arts studios, as well as an
outdoor jogging path. These facilities support the delivery of holistic
education, and facilitate engaged learning in both academic and co-curriculum
education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students can look forward to new facilities that will support educational
approaches, which encourage more interaction and self-discovery, and facilitate
experiential and hands-on learning. The new facilities also better support
differentiated learning, to meet the learning needs of different groups
of students.</p>
