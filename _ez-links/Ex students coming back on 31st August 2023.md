Dear PGVP Alumni,

We understand that most of you are eager to visit the school and your teachers here in Punggol View.  We indeed look forward to seeing you. However, this year, as our school is a designated Polling Centre we have to hand over our premises to the Election Team by noon. We will need time to prepare our premises and as such we regret to inform you that we are not able to accept any former students on Thu 31 August. We seek your kind understanding on this matter.

Thank you and we wish you all the best in your new schools.

From
School Leaders and Staff of PGVP
