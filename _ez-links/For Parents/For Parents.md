#### \[Parent Kit\] Transitioning Back to School - It's a New Normal for us all

Dear parents, &nbsp;

With the end of the Circuit Breaker on 1 Jun 2020, we enter the phase of safe opening. 2 Jun 2020 marks the beginning of a brand new school term. This new term with new arrangements and routines will be a new normal for all of us.&nbsp;

We hope that this issue of Parent Kit will help you to understand Back to School arrangements better and how you can guide your children to adjust back to school.

We also ask for your support to keep our school and children safe, as you have done before the start of Full HBL. Pages 7 to 10 of the Parent Kit provides information on how you can do so.

In Punggol View Primary School, we are working behind the scenes to prepare our school to ensure the safety our students so that learning can continue when school re-opens. We look forward to welcoming our students back in school!

#### \[Parent Kit\] Part 2: Home-Based Learning - Don't Worry, Be Steady!

Dear parents,&nbsp;

Starting from 8 Apr 2020, we will shift to Full Home-Based Learning (HBL) till 4 May 2020. It is an important stage in our fight against COVID-19 where we need to stay home, stay safe, and help our children stay curious.

Last week’s HBL has helped all of us to be better prepared. There will be issues and challenges as we move to Full HBL, but let’s work together to overcome them.&nbsp;

HBL cannot fully replace physical learning in school, but it will ensure that our children will be able to progress with learning while remaining safe.

We have come through challenges before, we can do it again. Let us partner to guide our children to tide through this and emerge stronger.

This issue of Parent Kit aims to help you understand what HBL is and how you can support your children during the period of Full HBL.

We hope you find the issue useful, especially for those of you who are also working from home.&nbsp;

Stay home, stay safe, stay curious.
