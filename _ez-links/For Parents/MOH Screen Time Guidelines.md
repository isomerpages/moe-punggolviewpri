<p><strong>Dear Parents and Guardians,</strong>
</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry
of Education (MOE), and Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)
have jointly launched <strong>Grow Well SG</strong>, a national health promotion
strategy aimed at enhancing preventive care and fostering healthier lifestyles
among children and adolescents. This multi-ministry initiative addresses
the holistic health and well-being of our youth in the digital age.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Screen Use Guidelines for Children Aged 0-12 Years</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the Grow Well SG initiative, MOH has developed guidelines for
screen use among children aged 0 to 12 years. These guidelines are based
on extensive research conducted by MOH, which you can access by downloading
the full report <a href="https://isomer-user-content.by.gov.sg/3/dc21db37-3dde-4cdb-9b9f-773d93c93f93/Guidance on Screen Use in Children (18 Jan)-clean.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>

<p><strong>Understanding Screen Use: Benefits and Risks</strong>
</p>
<p>While screens and digital devices can offer educational benefits, they
also pose potential risks to children's health and development. To mitigate
these risks, we strongly encourage families to adopt healthy screen use
habits as outlined in the guidelines:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Limit Screen Time</strong>: Restrict screen use to <strong>2 hours per day</strong>,
excluding time spent on school-related homework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop a Screen Use Plan</strong>: Collaborate with your child
to create a structured plan for screen time that includes agreed-upon limits
and activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Internet Access</strong>: Avoid providing unlimited and
unrestricted access to the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Media Restrictions</strong>: Children under 13 years old
should not have access to social media platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set Up Parental Controls</strong>: Implement parental controls
on your child’s devices to monitor and manage their online activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Screen-Free Zones</strong>: Establish rules for <strong>no screen time</strong> during
meals and for <strong>1 hour before bedtime</strong> to promote healthier
habits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Parental Control Resources</strong>
</p>
<p>If your child has access to or owns a device, please ensure that parental
controls are set up. Below are links to resources that can assist you in
configuring parental controls on various operating systems:</p>

<p><strong>Research Insights</strong>
</p>
<p>We also encourage you to view the video research conducted by SUSS, which
explores the impact of excessive screen time on cognitive development among
Singaporean adolescents. This research highlights how screen time can affect
learning and future work life. You can find the video titled <strong>“No Phone, No Life?”</strong> on
MeWatch or access it <a href="link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

for our students at home. Together, we can foster a healthier digital environment
