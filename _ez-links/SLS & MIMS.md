<h4><strong>CHANGE PASSWORD FIRST, IN MIMS PORTAL</strong></h4>
<p>1. Go to the MIMS portal to change password first at&nbsp;<a href="https://idp.mims.moe.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://idp.mims.moe.gov.sg/</a>
<br>- Username is the student's e-mail address (If don't know, please ask
Form Teacher)</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>2. MIMS SELF SERVICE PASSWORD RESET (SSPR)</strong></h4>
<p>- After the first login page, you will see the blue "MIMS Self Service
Password Reset" Window.
<br>- Type in the username again, and type in the password again.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>3. SETUP SECURITY QUESTION</strong></h4>
<p>- Choose 3 questions, and remember the answers, as it will be easy for
you to retrieve your password if you have forgotten it, or if you get locked
out.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>4. CHANGE PASSWORD</strong></h4>
<p>- Follow the password policy, and type in your new password. It must meet
the requirements.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>5. PASSWORD ACCEPTED</strong></h4>
<p>- If your new password is accepted, the system will change it.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>6. PASSWORD SUCCESSFULLY&nbsp;CHANGED</strong></h4>
<p>- If you changed it successfully, you can proceed. If password change
fails, you will most likely have to request another reset.&nbsp;
<br>- Remember the new password requirements.&nbsp;
<br>- Do not re-use old passwords, do not put in name, BC number, date of
birth in the new password. It will be rejected.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>LOG IN TO SLS</strong></h4>
<p>After password change in MIMS portal, you can just click on the SLS shortcut
and you will get into SLS.</p>
