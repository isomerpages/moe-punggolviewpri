#### PUNGGOL VIEW PRIMARY SCHOOL ALUMNI 2022

The Alumni has been established to reinforce a sense of belonging and reconnection among former students, to nurture the school spirit, foster a sense of pride for the school and at the same time, providing them with a platform to contribute to the school.

In alignment with the school’s mission of Touching Lives, Inspiring Future, former students are strongly encouraged to return as alumni members to share their experiences and skills to further enrich the school. All old boys and girls of Punggol View Primary are urged to come on-board and join us in making our Alumni a vibrant community to help support achieving our school’s vision.
