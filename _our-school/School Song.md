### Lyrics

<h3 style="color:black" align="center">"We are Punggol View"</h4>

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Lyrics by Staff of Punggol View <br>Music by Mrs Melody Leong</i></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Verse 1</strong><br> I am a starfish<br>Here in Punggol View.<br>All of us are precious gems<br>Sparkling, shining in many ways.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Verse 2</strong><br> We grow and glow together<br>To be the persons of character.<br>Live our values every day,<br>Give of our best in all we do.</p>

**Verse 2**  
We grow and glow together  
To be the persons of character.  
Live our values every day,  
Give of our best in all we do.

**Chorus**  
We are from Punggol View  
The precious ones, the happy ones.  
Working in harmony,  
Caring for this family.  
Standing for what is right,  
Respecting one and all.

Never give up before we’ve tried (‘cause)  
In all that we do,  
It’s with all of our heart.  
For all that we do,  
We are Punggol View.
