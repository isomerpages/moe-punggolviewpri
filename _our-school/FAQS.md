Punggol View Primary is one of the seven new primary schools that took in students from 2013. As recommended by the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Committee, the school has new design norms such as redesigned classrooms, dance and performing arts studios, as well as an outdoor jogging path. These facilities support the delivery of holistic education, and facilitate engaged learning in both academic and co-curriculum education.

Students can look forward to new facilities that will support educational approaches, which encourage more interaction and self-discovery, and facilitate experiential and hands-on learning. The new facilities also better support differentiated learning, to meet the learning needs of different groups of students.
