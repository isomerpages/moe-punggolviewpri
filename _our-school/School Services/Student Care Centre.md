### RAFFLES STUDENT CARE 
---------------------

  

Established in 2008, Raffles Student Care is a member of the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise. As a sustainable Social Enterprise with a strong social mission, we are guided by our Vision in Building Our Next Generation. 

  

Raffles Student Care seeks to teach core values of Resilience, Responsibility, Respect, Integrity, Care and Harmony to our young wards.

We seek to develop confident, competent and expressive children through a combination of experiential learning, role-play, and movement-based exercises.
