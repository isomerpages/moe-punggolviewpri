<p>The school currently offers classes to Primary 1 to 6 students. The Mother
Tongue Languages that are offered are Malay Language, Tamil Language (Primary
1 to 5 only) and Chinese Language.</p>
<h3>School Operating Hours</h3>
<p>In alignment with PERI's recommendations, Punggol View Primary School
operates as a single-session school so as to commit more space and time
for values-based holistic education. To facilitate this, the school starts
at 7.30 am. This will allow our students to have adequate rest and quality
time with their parents before they start school every day.</p>
