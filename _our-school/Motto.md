<p style="text-align:center;">
“Grow and Glow” is an aspiration that as the school grows, it will glow in the community as a school of distinction. It also reflects the focus of the school to grow our students' moral, emotional, social, cognitive, aesthetic and physical domains to the full so that they will glow to become persons of character who are good and useful citizens of tomorrow.</p></body>
