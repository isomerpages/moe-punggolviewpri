The Ministry of Education (MOE) has released a refreshed set of guidelines on the development of positive school-home partnerships. The previous guideline was initially released in 2019. The new School-Home Partnership Guidelines is a joint effort by COMPASS (COMmunity and PArents in Support of Schools) and Ministry of Education, Singapore (MOE). The refreshed guideline places our common desired outcomes at the centre so that both parents and schools will raise a HAPPY, CONFIDENT and KIND generation together.
