#### Mother's Day Activities

We recognize that the teachers are not able to work with your child to make a present for mummy to celebrate Mother’s Day this year. Nonetheless, we have prepared some Mother’s Day activities to provide your child with the opportunity to express their love and gratitude for mummy.

#### Videos from our teachers (4th May)

Our teachers have prepared a video to connect with your child and to share some tips on keeping safe during this critical period. We hope you can let your child watch the video and share with us things that you’ve been doing at home too! You can follow the link below to view the videos:
