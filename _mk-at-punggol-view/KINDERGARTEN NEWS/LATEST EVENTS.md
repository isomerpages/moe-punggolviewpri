<h4>Chinese New Year Celebration</h4>
<p>On 9 Feb 2024, our children celebrated Chinese New Year with a list of
fun-filled activities! Our children created dragon crafts, tossed Yu Sheng
and tasted Chinese New Year goodies such as love letters and pineapple
tarts with their teachers and friends. They also enjoyed a skit of the
legend of Nian, put up by their teachers. Towards the end of the celebration,
children received oranges and exchanged Chinese New Year greetings, wishing
everyone “Xin Nian Kuai Le (新年快乐)”!&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Racial Harmony Day</h4>
<p>
<br>On 21 July 2023, our children celebrated Racial Harmony Day through a
series of activities including slides and video sharing, traditional costume
fashion show and purchasing of traditional snacks using coupons at the
food cart. Through these activities, children were able to find out more
about Racial Harmony Celebration in Singapore, learn more about the different
cultures and recognise the importance of respecting and appreciating one
another regardless of race.</p>

<h2>National Day</h2>
<p>Our children celebrated National Day on the 8 August 2023. As part of
the celebration, children from the respective classes worked on a piece
of decorative craft to decorate the school. Children watched a skit of
“Sang Nila Utama” (performed by the teachers) following his adventure to
discover the island ‘Singapura’. Children also went on a “Gallery Walk”
down places of interests in Singapore to find out more about Singapore
history. We then end off the celebration with a mass dance to the year’
NDP song ‘Shine Your Light’.</p>
