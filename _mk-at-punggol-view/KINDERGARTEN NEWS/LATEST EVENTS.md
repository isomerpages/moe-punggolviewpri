<h4><br>Deepavali Celebration</h4>
<p>Our children celebrated Deepavali through an engaging interactive session
in the music room, led by our parent volunteers. They also watched a teacher-led
skit on the Story of Deepavali (Rama and Sita) to better understand why
Hindus celebrate this festival. During snack time, the children had the
opportunity to taste traditional Indian treats such as murukku, banana
chips, and sweet boondhi.</p>
