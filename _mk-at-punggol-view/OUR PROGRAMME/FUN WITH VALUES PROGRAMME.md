<h1>Values, Social and Emotional Competencies and Learning Dispositions (VSLDs)</h1><h1></h1><p>It is important to nurture values, social and emotional competencies and learning dispositions in young children. These three aspects of development are core to children’s holistic development. They set the stage for character building and lifelong learning, shaping children’s attitudes, behaviours and decisions that they make in their daily interactions.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/4__VSLDs.png"></div><h1>Fun with Values Programme</h1><p>Our programme introduce one value to children and their family for about 5 weeks. By the end of the 5 weeks, a home kit will be distributed for families to reinforce the value at home.
