# Values, Social and Emotional Competencies and Learning Dispositions (VSLDs)
# 
It is important to nurture values, social and emotional competencies and learning dispositions in young children. These three aspects of development are core to children’s holistic development. They set the stage for character building and lifelong learning, shaping children’s attitudes, behaviours and decisions that they make in their daily interactions.

# Fun with Values Programme #

Our programme introduce one value to children and their family for about 5 weeks. By the end of the 5 weeks, a home kit will be distributed for families to reinforce the value at home. Parents are also encouraged to volunteer to read relevant books on the values to the children as an introduction to the programme.
