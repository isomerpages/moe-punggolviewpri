<p>Families play an important role in nurturing children’s holistic development.
We routinely involve families in children’s learning through our Leading
and Inspiring Families of Early Learners @ MOE Kindergarten (LIFE@MK) programme.</p>
<p>

<p>LIFE@MK is a series of workshops and sharing sessions conducted by MK
educators for parents. We share:</p>
<p>•What your child learns at MK.</p>
<p>•Teaching and learning approaches that are appropriate for your child’s
development.</p>
<p>•Practical tips to help you nurture your child's holistic development
at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•Information on specific topics, such as supporting your child’s transition
to primary school and appropriate use of ICT tools.</p>

<p>The K1 LIFE@MK session was held on the 16 August 2024. The ‘Start Small
Dream Big (SSDB) project was the highlight for the year Life@MK session.
Parents were invited to join us in this meaningful journey. Our SSDB project
aims to promote environmental awareness, it comprised an interactive and
engaging skit on the importance of recycling and sustainability, a recycling
drive where children and their parents were encouraged to bring in recyclables
to school and a learning journey to Sustainable Singapore Gallery at Marina
Barrage. Children learnt the importance of environmental sustainability
through the 3Rs- Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. They also used recyclables
to repurpose them into items such as toys and accessories. Parents were
also invited to have a fun upcycling hands-on session to make finger puppets,
bookmarks and pointer with cardboard boxes together with their child.</p>
