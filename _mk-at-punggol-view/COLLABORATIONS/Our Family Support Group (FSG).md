<p>Children achieve optimal learning outcomes when the significant adults
in their lives—teachers and parents—collaborate to provide support. This
collaboration helps bridge the gap between home and school, ultimately
boosting children's interest and motivation in the learning process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At MK@PV, our Family Support Group (FSG) is dedicated to cultivating a
closer partnership between families and the school. Parents actively volunteered
in organizing events, participating in sharing sessions, and engaging in
various activities. The FSG played a crucial role in supporting the preparations
for Racial Harmony Day and Teachers’ Day events. Additionally, parents
took the initiative to conduct storytelling sessions for our children.
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to them for their unwavering support.</p>
