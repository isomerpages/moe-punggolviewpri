**ON TO A STRONG START!**  

Dear Parents,

Are you looking for a quality and affordable kindergarten programme for your pre-school child?

At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are curious, active and competent learners. We nurture children holistically, so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.

Our curriculum is developed by MOE’s curriculum specialists and trained educators with knowledge and experience in early childhood education and who are familiar with the primary school curriculum. Your child will embark on an exciting learning journey at MOE Kindergarten through our two flagship programmes – the HI-Light Programme and the Starlight Literacy Programme.

We warmly welcome you and your child to sign up for the MOE Kindergarten Virtual Open House taking place from **9.30am to 12.30pm on Saturday, 29 January 2022**, to find out why MK is the quality pre-school choice for children and how we ignite joy of learning in them!
