#### Programmes

##### Provision of Quality Learning Experiences for Our Students

<p style="color:black" align="center"><i>Our belief<br>“I hear, I forget,<br>I see, I remember,<br>I do, I understand”<br>- Confucius</i></p>

We support our students in their learning of Science using the 5E Instructional Model approach, namely: _Engage_, _Explore_ , _Explain_ , _Evaluate_ and _Extend_ . 

**Engage** our students through carefully designed learning activities to allow our students to explore scientific concepts in an active manner.

As our students **explore** through these activities, they discuss and **explain** the concepts to their classmates, which helps to develop their conceptual understanding of the concepts. They will also **evaluate** the concepts acquired.

  
After learning, students also need to extend their learning by applying the concepts into their daily lives or activities.


This 5E approach allows our students to progress from concrete experiences to the development of understanding and application of concepts.

<p><u>Happy Hall</u></p>
Happy hall sessions allow teachers to engage pupils to apply science in daily life. During these sessions, science teachers share Just-In-Time scientific phenomena or discoveries with the pupils. The sessions serve as a platform to engage pupils on learning about science and the teachers will continue the conversations in the science classrooms.

<p><u>Earth Week and Green Initiatives across PGVP</u></p>

Earth week include many activities that take place during assembly and recesses. These activities allows pupils to understand their roles in protecting the Earth and conserving precious resources.

Our pupils and staff participate in a year-long sustained efforts in recycling. Green monitors are trained to carry out the recycling programme in school. The green monitors are also given opportunities to participate in external competitions or programmes organised by environmental agencies.

<p><u>E2K (Science)</u></p>

This programme is offered to primary 4 and primary 5 pupils who are performing well and has a keen interest in Science. The programme aims to foster independence and confidence in scientific inquiry as well as to develop science process skills. Pupils collaborate with their peers and engage in science experiments and discussions. Through the programme, pupils gain 21st century competencies such as resilience, critical and inventive thinking and effective communicative skills.
