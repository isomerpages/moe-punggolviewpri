#### Integration of Science with English curriculum – Science Talk

We integrate science into the Primary 1 and Primary 2 English curriculum to arouse our students’ curiosity and interest in Science.  Our students are given a rich learning experience that is linked to the Big Book that has been read during Shared Reading.

After reading the Big Book, “A butterfly is born”, our students adopt and take care of caterpillars.  They also observe the changes that take place during the different stages of the life cycle of a caterpillar and record their observations.

Also, after reading the Big Book, “Magnetic Max”, our Primary 2 students use the different types of magnets to find out the interaction between them.  In the process, they learn the correct scientific terms such as “attract” and “repel”. 

These Science Talk experiences provide our students with the context as well as the content to think and talk about Science.

#### Integration of Science into Project Work – Scientific Discovery

Science is integrated with our school-based Project Work to allow our students to comprehend, synthesise and apply the scientific concepts that they have learnt and applied into real life situations.  We use the 5E Instructional Model approach, namely: Engage, Explore, Explain, Evaluate and Extend to guide our students in their construction of new knowledge. 

Primary 3 students learn about the scientific discovery of the life cycle of a plant and use their Maths skills to compute and record their observations.  Here our students are assigned to take care of a local vegetable, kangkong. They will observe the vegetable's growth through the plotting of a graph and develop the concept of green revolution. They also learn about agriculture and the need for Singapore to be self-sufficient in its food supply.  

Primary 4 students learn about the scientific discovery of the concept of magnetism and recycling. Art lessons are used to create 3-D structure using magnets and recyclable materials to create a toy.
