### Provision of Quality Learning Experiences for Our Students

<p style="color:black" align="center"><i>Our belief<br>“I hear, I forget,<br>I see, I remember,<br>I do, I understand”<br>- Confucius</i></p>

We support our students in their learning of Science using the 5E Instructional Model approach, namely: _Engage_ , _Explore_ , _Explain_ , _Evaluate_ and _Extend_ . 

**Engage** our students through carefully designed learning activities to allow our students explore scientific concepts in an active manner.

As our students **explore** through these activities, they discuss and **explain** the concepts to their classmates, which helps to develop their conceptual understanding of the concepts. They will also **evaluate** the concepts acquired.

After learning, students also need to extend their learned concepts by applying the concepts into their daily lives or activities.

This 5E approach allows our students to progress from concrete experiences to the development of understanding and application of concepts.

#### Happy Hall Programme

On Tuesday mornings, Science teachers share with the students how Science can be applied in their daily lives. The teachers will demonstrate a science experiment before linking to a real-life situation.
