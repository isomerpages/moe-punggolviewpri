<h4><strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong></h4>
<p>Building of Character through Outdoor Experiential Learning (OEL) is our
niche and the focus of our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Punggol
View Primary School (PGVP). The distinctive feature of the LLP is that
during OEL Week, the school infuses learning and character building through
programmes such as camps for Primary 4 to Primary 6 and learning journeys
at other levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programmes during OEL week will provide our students with rich learning
experiences outside the classroom, build up their resilience and ruggedness,
as well as inculcate values in them. This will allow them to build their
character and leadership responsibilities. Lower primary will experience
learning journeys that integrates with other teaching subjects and upper
primary will experience a 2D1N, 3D2N OAL Cohort Camp and a 1 day Motivational
Camp, where students have opportunities to apply their learning in an authentic
context through a variety of OEL experiences.</p>
<p>Experiential learning engages students in contexts that are personally
relevant to them. This approach to learning also involves making opportunities
for debriefing and consolidation of ideas and skills through feedback,
reflection and the application of the ideas and skills to new situations.
Outdoor makes an ideal classroom for experiential learning as it allows
students to immerse in the rich environment coupled with a sense of adventure,
the freedom to make mistakes, the sense of exhilaration when achievement
overcomes fears and most importantly, the excitement about learning about
oneself. Hence the distinctive feature of our LLP is that we combine experiential
learning with the outdoors so that we can build the character of our students.</p>
