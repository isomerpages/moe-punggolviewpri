#### PGVP Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - Effective & Empathetic Communicators (E²C@PGVP)
We are pleased to announce that our application for ALP has been approved at the end of 2020. Our ALP will focus on communication and we aim to leverage real-life issues and authentic problems to equip our students with effective communicative skills, grounded in values and expressing empathy in communication to achieve impact, effect and affect. Our ALP, entitled Effective and Empathetic Communicators (E²C @ PGVP), seeks to address a key competence on “Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills” which are important future ready skills for our students. 

We will leverage our existing oracy (speaking and listening) programmes as we believe that oracy skills are the foundation to literacy. Classroom talk helps students to learn and reflect on what they are learning and communicate their knowledge and understanding. Our students need authentic opportunities to learn how to listen and speak effectively in a variety of situations. By taking the time to teach specific oral strategies to our students, we will be working towards helping them to be effective in their communication. By doing so, we aim to boost their confidence and performance, which in turn will help develop our students to become effective and empathetic communicators.

Our ALP will be critical in helping us achieve our vision – Confident Learners. Active Citizens, and in developing our students to be effective and reflective communicators. We will be implementing our ALP in 2021 and we look forward to your continued partnership.

#### PGVP Learning For Life Programme (LLP) - Building of Character through Outdoor Experiential Learning (OEL)
OEL is our niche and the focus of our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) here in Punggol View Primary School. A key focus of our LLP is to infuse learning and character building into camps for P3 to P6 and learning journeys at each level. Each year, we dedicate a week during Term 1 Week 10 as our OEL Week.

During the OEL week, we consolidate our OEL activities for all levels (see below under Upcoming Events in Term 1). For 2021, learning journeys and residential camps (overnight) remain suspended. We will conduct non-residential camps (no overnight stay) for P3 to P6, with appropriate SMM in place.

Activities conducted will be capped at 50 participants each with students in groups of 8 or less. Activities that require high rates of physical contact will not be conducted. More details will be given to you nearer to the date.
