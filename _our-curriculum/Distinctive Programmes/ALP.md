<h4><strong>ALP (Applied Learning Programme)</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Effective and Empathetic Communicator (E<sup>2</sup>C @ PGVP)</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The school's ALP, EÂ²C @ PGVP, focuses on communication, collaboration,
and information skills and seeks to equip students with effective communicative
skills grounded in values and empathy. In PGVP, we believe that Oracy skills
are foundation to literacy. Classroom talk helps students to learn, reflect
on what they are learning, and communicate their knowledge and understanding.
Our students need authentic opportunities to learn how to listen and speak
effectively in a variety of situations. By taking the time to teach specific
oral strategies and dispositions in communication to our students, we will
be working towards in helping them to be effective and empathetic in their
communication. In PGVP ALP, we will also be teaching our students perspective
taking skills and other important values to help them show empathy while
communicating with others. By doing so, we aim to boost their confidence
and performance, which in turn will help develop our students to become
effective and empathetic communicators. PGVP ALP is critical to achieving
the school's vision of confident learners and active citizens.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Programmes of E<sup>2</sup>C @ PGVP</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different programmes designed for the different levels from
Primary 1 to Primary 6. Students in Primary 1 and Primary 2 will learn
communication skills in fun-filled lessons. These lessons will develop
our students in different skills: being confident in their interaction
with others, take on the perspectives of others while sharing and also
the various dispositions when interacting with others. In Primary 3, our
students will put what they have learnt earlier in a story telling competition.
In Primary 4, Primary 5 and Primary 6, our students will learn basic journalism
skills to help them become mini reporters, emcees or take part in other
related competitions.</p>
<p>Our Star Studio @ PGVP is a media performance and recording facility that
plays an important role in the school's efforts to develop effective and
empathetic communicators. The studio is well equipped with broadcasting
and journalism equipment to support and develop our students in their journey
to become effective and empathetic communicators. Ever since the setup
of the studio, our teachers and students have been using it to produce
videos for various school programmes and our in house production.</p>
