<p>The Singapore Student Learning Space is a platform that will support Teaching
and Learning in Punggol View Primary School. In particular, it will help
empower our students to drive their own learning according to their needs
and interests. By spurring our students to take greater ownership of their
learning and work collaboratively with their peers, the SLS aims to support
them towards becoming responsible future-ready learners.</p>
<p>The SLS allows our students to take greater ownership of their learning
and work collaboratively. In line with 21CC development, the SLS seeks
to encourage learners to be self-directed and collaborative and promote
student ownership. Through this process, students will discover the&nbsp;<strong>joy of learning.</strong>
