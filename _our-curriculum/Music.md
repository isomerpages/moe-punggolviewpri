#### Curricular Goal:
Our students are motivated participants and appreciative audience of the Arts.

#### Programmes:
**Music Learning Framework**

The music curriculum in Punggol View Primary is anchored on creating direct experiences in Listening and Responding, Creating and Performing Music. It is through these music-making activities, at the end of six years of music education, students develop 
•	an awareness and appreciation of music of various cultures, 
•	an ability for creative expression and communication through music, and
•	an understanding of music elements and concepts.

#### How Lessons are Taught
Music lessons are planned and delivered using the Experience – Concept – Application (ECA) approach. 

In the Experience phase, students experience and perceive a new concept through singing and accompanying kinaesthetic, aural and visual activities usually in the form of games. This phase provides a stimulus and preparation for the concept to be introduced. It also enables the teacher to reach out to the different learning styles and needs in a class.

In the Concept phase, the teacher helps students to relate the activities in the Experience phase to formal learning. It allows students to make sense of the prior activities and to understand the musical concept.

The Application phase involves various forms of practice and reinforcement. It also helps to develop critical and creative thinking while extending our students’ learning.
