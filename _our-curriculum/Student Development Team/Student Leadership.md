#### Curricular Goal

**Every student is a Self-Leader who is anchored in the R3ICH values**

  

Students are developed in their Moral Character (Do The Right Thing) and Performance Character (Give Of Your Best)

  

#### Planning and Implementation

**Framework**

Anchored in our R³ICH values, our Student Leadership Framework consists of 3 main pillars designed to support the school’s student leadership development efforts:

  

1. Skills and Knowledge – Development of the 3-tiered leadership skills and knowledge (personal leadership, team leadership, servant leadership)

2. Experience – Providing relevant experience for all students through various leadership development platforms (leadership for the masses, leadership for emergent leaders, leadership for talented leaders)

3. Appreciation and Affirmation – Appreciation and affirmation for the students’ contribution to the class, school and community
