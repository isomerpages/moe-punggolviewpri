<p>Here in Punggol View, we believe in making a difference in the lives of
every student. Through PosEd, we aim to develop the holistic well-being
of each student based on Martin Seligmanâ€™s PERMAH model.</p>

<p>Every morning, students practise Positive Self-Talk and Mindful Breathing.
These allows them to feel good about themselves and set their intentions
for the day. Students explored their Character Strengths through online
SLS lessons and were given platforms to showcase their strengths. They
are also learning to use the Growth Mindset model to hone their Character
Strengths.</p>
