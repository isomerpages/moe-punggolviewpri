Chinese Language Unit started CL Touch-Typing Program in 2018 to develop students to be future-ready learners who can leverage technology to achieve subject discipline outcomes.

#### 2019 Malay Language Unit Workshop for Parents 'Waris Baca Cerita'

On 30 January 2019, more than 100 parents and students attended a reading technique workshop conducted by PGVP Malay Language Unit. The workshop, entitled ‘Waris Baca Cerita’, was graced by Senior Parliamentary Secretary and Chairman of the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC), Dr. Faishal Ibrahim and was featured in the Malay News programme on Suria Channel.

During the workshop, parents and students were guided on ways to hone their reading and storytelling skills.  Interesting reading tips and storytelling techniques were shared to parents so that they could instil a love for reading in their children.  The workshop was designed based on the popular reader series, Nabil Nabilah, which were written by our very own Punggol View Malay Language teachers.

The series, filled with moral values written in the Singapore context have been well-received by parents throughout Singapore. The series was first launched in 2015 for Primary 1 and 2 pupils, while books for Primary 3 and 4 were launched last year. At the event, Dr Faishal also announced that books for K1 and K2 children, as well as Primary 5 and 6 students, will be rolled out by 2021. We were indeed grateful for this opportunity. The PDF versions of the books can be accessed via [https://www.mllpc.sg/publications](https://www.mllpc.sg/publications).
