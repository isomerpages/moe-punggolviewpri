<p>The students will take part in an annual calligraphy competition. This
competition aims to develop in our students the patience in writing Chinese
words, appreciate the beauty of Chinese characters, as well as recognise
the efforts put in by our students to write beautifully. Many students
look forward to take part in this competition as they get to meet students
from other schools with the same interest.</p>
