<p>PAL is an integral part of the curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students.
The programme offers hands-on and experiential learning through the following
four domains: Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing
Arts. PAL provides opportunities for students to discover new interests,
develop character and enables them to develop social-emotional competencies.</p>

<p>In Punggol View Primary School, all P1 and P2 students undergo Programme
for Active Learning (PAL) modules during school hours. With these modules
spread over the two years, we hope to provide our students with broad-based
exposure in the areas of Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Visual and
Performing Arts and an avenue for learning values and Social Emotional
skills.</p>

<p>For the Programme Design for PAL, we adopted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Play-based Storyline Approach to design our lessons, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience-Inquiry Pedagogy to allow students to be engaged in group and
individual learning as well as asking questions to evoke their curiosity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Play-based storyline lesson design involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using story books to provide the context and content for learning. Children
naturally love to read stories and this is one way to get them hooked-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purposeful play is incorporated to allow the students to explore and engage
their five senses as well as to exhibit the SE Competencies and values</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the experiential-inquiry pedagogy to allow children to learn by
doing and asking questions as well as to interact and co-create their learning
in a fun and engaging way.</p>
