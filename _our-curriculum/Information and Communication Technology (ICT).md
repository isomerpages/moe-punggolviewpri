The Singapore Student Learning Space is a platform that will support Teaching and Learning in Punggol View Primary School. In particular, it will help empower our students to drive their own learning according to their needs and interests. By spurring our students to take greater ownership of their learning and work collaboratively with their peers, the SLS aims to support them towards becoming responsible future-ready learners.

  

The SLS allows our students to take greater ownership of their learning and work collaboratively. In line with 21CC development, the SLS seeks to encourage learners to be self-directed and collaborative and promote student ownership. Through this process, students will discover the **joy of learning.**

It is important for students to be equipped with the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to demonstrate respect for self and others, and to practice safe and responsible use.
