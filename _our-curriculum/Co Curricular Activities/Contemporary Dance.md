The International Dance CCA was one of the first few CCAs offered in our school in 2014. Since then, our Dance Crew has been involved in many performances such as the school’s Opening Ceremony in 2015, Kaleidoscope in 2017 as well as our annual Teacher’s Day and Prize-giving Day concerts.

The Contemporary Dance CCA aims to inculcate the love for dance as well as to further develop and enhance their interest in the art and its various forms in our students. As such, students are introduced to the different genres of dance such as street jazz, ballet and hip-hop. More importantly, students will be able to learn the importance of teamwork and display the R3ICH values as they practice and perform together.

In November 2019, 20 of our Dance Crew members participated in a Primary School Dance Camp at St. Joseph’s Institution (Junior). Students were able to make new friends as they learn new dance techniques and choreograph a routine together. It was both a fun and enriching experience for them.

This year (2020), our Dance Crew will participate in our third Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) presentation in mid-April. They have been learning new dance techniques and at the same time, strengthening their bond as a team in preparation for the presentation. Do wish them all the best in their endeavour. We can do it!
