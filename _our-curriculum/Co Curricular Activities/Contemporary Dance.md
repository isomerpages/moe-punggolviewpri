<p>The International Dance CCA was one of the first few CCAs offered in our
school in 2014. Since then, our Dance Crew has been involved in many performances
such as the school’s Opening Ceremony in 2015, Kaleidoscope in 2017 and
PGVP’s 10th year anniversary concert in 2022.</p>
<p>The Contemporary Dance CCA aims to inculcate the love for dance as well
as to further develop and enhance their interest in the art and its various
forms in our students. As such, students are introduced to the different
genres of dance such as street jazz, ballet, hip-hop and even the K-Pop
genre. More importantly, students will be able to learn the importance
of teamwork and display the R3ICH values as they practice and perform together.</p>
<p>Every year, we participate in school performances such as National Day
Celebration, Teacher’s Day Concert and Prize Presentation Day. We have
even participated in 2023 Chinese New Year Celebration.</p>
<p>This year (2024), our Dance Crew will participate in our fourth Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF) presentation in mid-April. They have been learning
new dance techniques and at the same time, strengthening their bond as
a team in preparation for the presentation. The title for their SYF Presentation
is Alice’s Tea Party. Do wish them all the best in their endeavour. We
can do it!</p>
