Wushu is a form of Chinese martial arts that is often viewed as an exhibition and combat sports. The training and stroke emphasizes on quickness, powerful yet natural and relaxed movements. In PGVP Wushu CCA, our members will learn basic Quanshu followed by Qixie and/or Taijiquan as they progress through the sports. 

Throughout the year, school team members will participate in National Wushu Championships as well as numerous performances in school. The various forms of exposures can help to boost our performersâ€™ confidence. 

In PGVP Wushu CCA, we aim to expose our members to the culture and heritage of Chinese martial arts, as well as to inculcate good sportsmanship values in them. We want to develop our pupils physically, emotionally and socially so that they can graduate with a strong moral compass and learn values of respect, resilience, care, harmony, responsibility and integrity.
