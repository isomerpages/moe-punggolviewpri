<p>Wushu, a style of Chinese martial arts known for its blend of performance
and competitive elements, focuses on agile, forceful, and naturally flowing
movements. In our PGVP Wushu CCA program, participants start with basic
Quanshu techniques and progress to Qixie and/or Taijiquan as they advance.</p>
<p>Throughout the academic year, our school team actively participates in
both the National Wushu Championships and various school performances,
providing ample opportunities for our members to build their confidence.</p>
<p>Our main objective in the PGVP Wushu CCA is to expose students to the
rich cultural heritage of Chinese martial arts while instilling important
values of sportsmanship. We aim to develop our students holistically, nurturing
their physical, emotional, and social well-being, so they graduate with
a strong moral compass and embody values such as respect, resilience, care,
harmony, responsibility, and integrity.</p>
