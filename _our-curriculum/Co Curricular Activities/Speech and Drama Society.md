The Speech and Drama Society began as an enrichment programme for a selected group of students from Primary 2 to Primary 5. After the students' performance in August 2017 during Kaleidoscope, the enrichment programme is now offered as a CCA in Punggol View Primary School starting 2018.

Through joining the Speech and Drama Society, we hope to see students perform confidently a variety of Speech and Drama performances (skits, poetry recitation, choral reading etc). The students performed during the P1 Orientation Day in 2018 and their performance was very well-received. We will look forward to more performances from the Speech and Drama Society in 2020.
