<p>The Speech and Drama Society began as an enrichment programme for a selected
group of students. After the studentsâ€™ performance in August 2017 during
Kaleidoscope, the programme was turned into a CCA to give students a platform
for acting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the CCA sessions, we hope to develop good communication and critical
thinking skills in our students. Students get to work with peers across
levels to build teamwork and strengthen their acting and communication
skills so that they can perform confidently in public. Students would be
able to learn and apply drama techniques like voice projection and awareness
of space and improvisation. We hope to nurture students to become effective
and confident speakers.</p>
