Tag Rugby is a non-contact team game in which each player wears a belt with two Velcro tags attached to it. Attacking players attempt to dodge, evade and pass a rugby ball to score while defenders attempt to prevent scoring by “tagging” - pulling the Velcro tag of the ball carrier. It is a great platform to prepare players for contact rugby. 

Contact Rugby is a team sport and pupils who excel at Tag Rugby will be invited to train with the contact team. While rugby shares many similar skills of tag rugby, players will need to learn many new physical skills. Safety is a key priority, so our coach and dedicated team of teachers put in every effort to make learning safe and fun.

Throughout the year, the various teams take part in external carnivals, friendlies and the National Inter-Primary School Championship.

In Rugby, students will learn how to communicate effectively, work cooperatively and make responsible decisions. Rugby places as much importance on sportsmanship as on winning. It is a sport with values that develop players within a social and moral context: 

Respect for the rules, team mates, opponents, match officials and those involved in the game<br>
Responsibility for their own and team mates’ safety<br>
Resilience for working towards their goals<br>
Integrity through honesty and fair play<br>
Care for their team mates<br>
Harmony through a unifying spirit that leads to lifelong friendships, teamwork and loyalty.
