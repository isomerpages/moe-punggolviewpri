The Choir was established in 2015. Pupils from Primary 3, 4, 5 and 6 make up the Choir and sing under the able baton of Mr Acid Pang.
 
In the heart of what we do in the PGVP Choir are 5 student-centric, value-driven foci:
 
1. Choral-singing ~ In the PGVP Choir, we gather once a week to sing our hearts out in a happy and lively environment because we know that belting out a song is an enjoyable way to lift the spirits and express ourselves.

2. Harmony ~ Being a primary school choir, we do two-part singing, viz. the alto (lower range) and the soprano (higher range). It’s a thrill to shrill!

3. One-sound ~ We aim for voices rich in harmony and unity, so we have collaborative activities for team-building and bonding, eg. day camps, outings, concert-attendance, choir exchange programmes, performances, etc.

4. Ingenuity ~ The PGVP Choir experiences the joy of music-making and explores creativity in a cappella singing (unaccompanied singing), rhythmic movements and choreography.

5. Repertoire ~ To continue its musical growth and pursuit for excellence, the PGVP Choir sing a variety of vocal and local fare of songs.

Underpinning these is the alignment to one of our school’s MESCAP outcomes, Aesthetically Aware. Hence, through singing in the Choir, in addition to being a confident person, a self-directed learner, an active contributor and a concerned citizen, we hope to grow pupils who love the arts and have a zest for life, one of the Desired Outcomes of Education.

2017 was the Choir’s debut at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. With the dedication of the teachers and the support of the parents, the Choir clinched the heartening Certificate of Accomplishment award. The fervent efforts of our pupils and conductor have paid off!

The choir also took part in several performances in school and externally during festivals and celebrations. We look forward to having you join our CCA as a chorister or simply enjoy our singing as audience!
