<p>The Children’s Choir @ PGVP has been standing together in harmony since
its inception in 2015. Though there were many challenges during the Covid
circuit breaker period, the team persevered and practiced using online
and alternative methods to ensure that they remain strong and melodious.
When face-to-face training resumed, they took up the challenge and participated
in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2022, receiving great
support from the school.</p>
<p>Today, the team is under the good guidance of Ms Chu Xiao Yi, a dedicated
and experienced instructor who inspires the team to perform at their best.</p>
<p>In the heart of what we do in the PGVP Choir are 5 student-centric, value-driven
foci:</p>
<p>1. Choral-singing ~ In the PGVP Choir, we gather once a week to sing our
hearts out in a happy and lively environment because we know that belting
out a song is an enjoyable way to lift the spirits and express ourselves.</p>
<p>2. Harmony ~ Being a primary school choir, we do two-part singing, viz.
the alto (lower range) and the soprano (higher range). It’s a thrill to
shrill!</p>
<p>3. One-sound ~ We aim for voices rich in harmony and unity, so we have
collaborative activities for team-building and bonding, eg. day camps,
outings, concert-attendance, choir exchange programmes, performances, etc.</p>
<p>4. Ingenuity ~ The PGVP Choir experiences the joy of music-making and
explores creativity in acapella singing (unaccompanied singing), rhythmic
movements and choreography.</p>
<p>5. Repertoire ~ To continue its musical growth and pursuit for excellence,
the PGVP Choir sing a variety of vocal and local fare of songs.</p>
<p>The Choir also takes the opportunity to perform during school celebrations
and events. We look forward to having you join our CCA as a chorister or
simply enjoy our singing as part of the audience!</p>
