<h4><strong><em>‘Art is not what you see&nbsp;but what you make others see.’&nbsp; ~Edgar Degas~</em></strong></h4>
<p>The Young Artists’ Club promotes creativity with an inquisitive mind.
Our members are nurtured to develop their unique cognitive profile as well
as to achieve their potential artistic talents. They are encouraged to
expand their knowledge and showcase their talents. This is done by expressing
of ideas, feelings and experiences through the different art forms and
medium freely.</p>
<p>Our club also provides the students opportunities to participate in programs
such as Artist In School Scheme (AISS). This program provides an opportunity
for schools to partner with artist(s) to provide customized arts experiences
for students usually in workshops conducted by artists for students, establishing
artist-student interaction.</p>
<p>Students learn to work together as a team to design and create artworks
for the school/community. Through these activities, students will not only
be able to expand their passion in Art but also nurture their Social-Emotional
Skills and Values such as self-awareness; recognizing their strengths,
self-management; setting personal goals, social awareness; appreciating
diversity and recognizing others’ needs and interests, relationship management;
communicating and working cooperatively, responsible decision making; identifying
problems, brainstorming to solve problems and evaluating and reflecting
on personal, moral and ethical responsibility.</p>
