Punggol View Cub Scouts is the only Uniformed Group (UG) CCA offered in Punggol View Primary School.

  

Cub Scouts are trained under the four main categories: the cub scout curriculum, Leadership, Teamwork, Communication and Conflict Management. They will also be exposed to opportunities to learn and hone skills like basic wilderness survival, map reading, as well as packing and cleaning techniques.

  

At the end of three years, each cub will have had the opportunity to attend a leadership camp. Should they choose to commit to the experience, each cub scout will also have the opportunity to qualify for the Akela Award, Singapore's highest award for a cub scout

  

Each child will be exposed to training during weekly meetings that enables them to achieve the Gold Progress Badge by the time they graduate at Primary 6. At present, more than 60% of all cubs in Punggol View are qualified leaders. We aim to train all cub scouts by 2020.

Punggol View Cub Scouts is committed to the development and growth of our youths. We work in close partnership with other cub scout units in Punggol, as well as Secondary School Scout units. This allows each cub scout the opportunity to showcase their learning and qualify for the Direct School Admission (DSA) Program.

  

We look forward to having you join us on this Scouting journey!
