<p>The Service and Interact Club aims to instill in our students the love
of leading and serving – of family, school and wider community. Students
learn more about what makes a good leader and are given opportunities to
take charge of activities and events that hone leadership skills.</p>
<p>Students also volunteer at external organizations to develop their spirit
of service. These include old aged homes and hospitals to bring joy and
cheer to the residents. Through such outreach activities and interaction
with the wider public, students expand their perspectives of life and experience
the joys of service.</p>
<p>The Service and Interact Club welcomes students who wish to lead and serve
with willing hearts.</p>
