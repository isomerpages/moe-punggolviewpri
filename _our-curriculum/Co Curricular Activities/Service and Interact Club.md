The Service and Interact Club aims to instill in our students the love of leading and serving â€“ of family, school and wider community. Students learn more about what makes a good leader and are given opportunities to take charge of activities and events that hone leadership skills. 

Students also regularly volunteer at external organizations to develop their spirit of service. These include old aged homes and hospitals to bring joy and cheer to the residents. Through such outreach activities and interaction with the wider public, students expand their perspectives of life and experience the joys of service. 

The Service and Interact Club welcomes students who wish to lead and serve with willing hearts.
