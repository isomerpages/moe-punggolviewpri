Floorball is a fun and fast-paced sport played indoors with floorball sticks and a ball. The sport is easy to pick up with simple rules that one can easily learn in a matter of minutes. Whilst the sport has similarities to ice hockey, players do not require protective gear as the sport is relatively safe with rules against pushing, high stick, etc. Floorball is therefore suitable for young children and its popularity in Singapore has grown rapidly.  

  

In Punggol View Primary, apart from playing and learning the skills of the game, Floorball embraces a number of social and emotional skills. Students learn how to communicate effectively, work cooperatively and make responsible decisions.
