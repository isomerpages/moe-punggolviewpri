<p>Floorball is a fun and fast-paced sport played indoors with floorball
sticks and a ball. The sport is easy to pick up with simple rules that
one can easily learn in a matter of minutes. Whilst the sport has similarities
to ice hockey, players do not require protective gear as the sport is relatively
safe with rules against pushing, high stick, etc. Floorball is therefore
suitable for young children and its popularity in Singapore has grown rapidly.</p>
<p>In Punggol View Primary, apart from playing and learning the skills of
the game, Floorball embraces a number of social and emotional skills. Students
learn how to communicate effectively, work cooperatively, make responsible
decisions and exhibit sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, our Junior and Senior School Teams take part in invitational
tournaments, friendly matches and the National School Games.</p>
