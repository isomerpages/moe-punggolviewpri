#### Health Promoting School Canteen
The Health Promoting School Canteen Programme (HPSC) serves to bring Healthy Set Meals to students. This programme follows the existing Healthy Eating in School Programme (HESP) which introduces 10 food service guidelines in the school canteens.
The Healthy Set Meals incorporate the appropriate proportions of food from four main food groups rice and alternatives, meat and alternatives, fruit and vegetables based on Singapore’s Dietary Guidelines for Children and Adolescents ensuring that when students consume meals at the school, they will receive the right nutrients necessary for their growing needs. Each canteen stall serves at least two types of set meals per day and vendors are encouraged to change their menu daily to ensure variety.
