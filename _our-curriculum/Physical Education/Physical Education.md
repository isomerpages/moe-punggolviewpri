<h4><strong>Goals of Physical Education</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>1. Movement Competence. Students are competent and confident to participate
in a range of physical and outdoor activities.</p>
<p>2. Healthy Lifestyle Practices. Students have a personal commitment to
healthy lifestyle practices in physical activity, nutrition, sleep, outdoor
time and hygiene.</p>
<p>3. Safety Mindset. Students apply risk assessment to manage daily and
physical activities with respect to self, others and the environment.</p>
<p>4. Core Values. Students make informed and responsible decisions with
regard to personal behaviour and social interactions based on sound values-based
judgements.</p>
<p>5. Enjoyment. Students enjoy and value physical activities and healthy
living in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>The learning experiences leading to the goals of Physical Education at
the primary level are organised according to the three learning areas and
content areas/strands as shown below.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>Most content areas for Physical Activity (i.e., Dance, Games and Sports,
and Gymnastics), Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Safety are
introduced at Primary 1. For the other content areas under Physical Activity,
Athletics is introduced at Primary 4 and Swimming is to be completed by
Primary 6.</p>
<p>A balanced participation in Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics,
Swimming and Outdoor Education, with Physical Health and Safety blended
into the six areas, is essential to teach students the critical movement
skills and concepts. These essential building blocks for developing movement
competency provide the necessary movement vocabulary and experiences for
learning and performance.</p>

<p>Curriculum Framework<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Physical Education seeks to develop the whole child to bring about a nation
of physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime
of active and healthy living safely and responsibly.</p>
<p>The three learning areas of Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and
Physical Health and Safety are pivotal in providing the content for design
and enactment of students’ meaningful learning experiences in, about and
through movement, leveraging the physical and social environment in providing
real-life contexts to strengthen students’ learning. A balanced and well-designed
Physical Education curriculum, delivered through effective pedagogies and
purposeful assessment will enable students to apply the skills, knowledge,
practices and values to lead an active and healthy lifestyle, and acquire
the 21st century competencies to thrive in the fast changing and complex
world. Below shows a diagrammatic representation of the Physical Education
Curriculum Framework.</p>

<h4><strong>Developing 21st Century Competencies through Physical Education&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>Physical Education (PE) is more than just playing sports or exercising.
It's about developing important qualities in students that will help them
succeed in life. PE focuses on six core values: Respect, Resilience, Responsibility,
Integrity, Care, and Harmony. These values are connected to how students
think, feel, and act, which are part of what's called Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE).</p>
<p>In PE classes, students learn not only how to move and play sports but
also how to be better people. There are specific goals for each value,
and students are given different activities to help them learn and practise
these values as they grow through school. These activities are designed
to help students become better problem solvers, critical thinkers, and
communicators.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>For example, when students dance or do gymnastics, they get to be creative
and express themselves. In team sports, they learn how to work together,
communicate effectively, and solve problems on the spot. All of these activities
help students build important skills for the future, especially in today's
digital world.</p>
<p>So, PE isn't just about physical health—it's also about building character
and preparing students for success in life.</p>

<h4><strong><u>PAMtastic Week</u></strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>PAMtastic Week is a unique thematic collaboration between the Physical
Education, Art and Music Department. This is held in the 6th week of Term
1, 2 &amp; 3. PAMtastic week is a platform to develop students holistically
across all domains - Moral, Emotional, Social, Cognitive, Aesthetics and
Physical. The objective is to promote a Healthy Lifestyle that encompasses
Physical, Emotional and Health Awareness through PE, Arts (Visual) and
Music activities. We wish to inspire our students with a lifelong love
of learning by providing them with opportunities to explore, create, and
develop skills with a common theme. Different activities for each level
are specially curated to bring out the vibrancy of aesthetics in the school
and as a platform to showcase student's talent and diversity, while developing
their physical well-being.</p>

<h4><strong>Professional Development</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The PE Department has been very privileged to work with various professionals.&nbsp;
Dr. Sara Ashworth, Dr. Steve Mitchell and Associate Professor Chow Jia
Yi.</p>
<p>The late Dr. Sara Ashworth earned her MA from the University of Mississippi
and an EdD from Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. From 1987-2008,
Dr. Sara Ashworth taught the Spectrum of Teaching Styles in the Department
of Elementary Education at Florida Atlantic University (FAU).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Ashworth observed a total of 8 PE lessons conducted by our teachers
followed by post lesson discussions after each lesson on the Spectrum of
Teaching Styles used in teaching episodes focusing specifically on the
decision making processes and behavioural expectations. The team also explored
the possibilities of using the Inclusive Style (Slanting Rope idea) to
enable students with varied abilities to make decisions on performing different
levels of task representation.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Dr. Steve Mitchell, a professor of physical education teacher education
at Kent State University, received his undergraduate and master’s degrees
from Loughborough University, England, where the tactical approach was
developed. He earned a PhD in teaching and curriculum at Syracuse University.</p>
<p>The team of Punggol View Primary School (PGVP) Teachers worked with Dr.
Mitchell over 3 weeks on the Game Centred Approach. This approach taps
on inquiry, through the use of questions to allow students to take charge
of their own learning. The approach was carried out over 10 lessons, with
Dr. Mitchell teaching the first class of each lesson cycle before the respective
teachers made modifications to the lesson for their respective classes.
The collaboration involving Dr. Mitchell culminated in a demonstration
class for 20 teachers and officers from PESTA and PSOEB. The team of teachers
at PGVP then presented their two part collaboration at the 2020 Physical
and Sports Education Virtual Conference.</p>

<p>The NLP project utilizing a Constraints-Led Approach (CLA) in PE gymnastics,
a subset of Nonlinear Pedagogy (NLP), involves collaboration among 9 teachers
from 4 schools across different zones, with support from Dr. Chow Jiayi
(National Institute of Education), Gym Coach Mr. Sng, and Physical Education
&amp; Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>This collaborative effort aims to revolutionize gymnastics education by
embracing a student-centered approach that promotes exploratory learning
and variability in practice, as advocated by Chow et al. (2016).&nbsp;</p>
<p>By empowering students with autonomy to explore and discover individualized
movements, the project seeks to enhance decision-making skills and foster
confidence and competence among participants. Through careful planning
and delivery of engaging learning experiences, the project aims to provide
students with ample opportunities to develop both their physical and cognitive
abilities within the context of gymnastics.</p>
