##### Purpose of Physical Education
The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

##### Goals of Physical Education
A comprehensive, well-articulated syllabus helps students to achieve the goals of physical education. The six goals are equally important - each interacts with others in a well-planned programme that addresses the knowledge, skills and values desired for every student. Physical education seeks to develop in each student the ability to:

</style>

</body>

This syllabus is organised to achieve the goals of physical education based on the framework below. At the apex is the purpose of physical education, achieved through the learning areas to enable students to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their movement. Learning in the affective areas and competencies for the 21st century are both the outcomes and enablers for the learning of physical education. Through a balanced and well-designed curriculum, delivered through appropriate and effective pedagogies and meaningful assessment, students will acquire the knowledge, skills and values to live active and healthy lives.

<h5><strong>21 <sup>st</sup> Century Competencies in Physical Education </strong></h5>


Physical education provides a natural platform for students to clarify and act on their personal values. It allows for social interactions and demonstration of positive emotions as well as social behaviours. Through carefully designed learning activities and ‘teachable moments’ in physical education, students are given the opportunities to acquire sound moral values, develop social skills and higher order thinking skills, and 21st Century Competencies.

The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor (e.g. walk, run, hop, jump, leap, gallop, skip, slide) , non-locomotor (e.g. bend, stretch, twist, turn, push, pull, raise, lower, shake) and manipulative skills (e.g. toss, catch, throw, kick, strike) with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students’ performance. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.

#### Partnerships

  

The PE Department has been very privileged to host and work with two visiting fellows, Dr. Sara Ashworth and Dr. Steve Mitchell.

  

Dr. Sara Ashworth earned her MA from the University of Mississippi and an EdD from

Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. From 1987-2008, Dr. Sara Ashworth taught the Spectrum of Teaching Styles in the Department of Elementary Education at Florida Atlantic University (FAU). 

  

Dr. Ashworth observed a total of 8 PE lessons conducted by our teachers followed by post lesson discussions after each lesson on the Spectrum of Teaching Styles used in teaching episodes focusing specifically on the decision making processes and behavioural expectations. The team also explored the possibilities of using the Inclusive Style (Slanting Rope idea) to enable students with varied abilities to make decisions on performing different levels of task representation.

Dr. Steve Mitchell is a professor of physical education teacher education at Kent State University. He received his undergraduate and master’s degrees from Loughborough University, England, where the tactical approach was developed. He earned a PhD in teaching and curriculum at Syracuse University.

  

The team of Punggol View Primary School (PGVPS) Teachers worked with Dr. Mitchell over 3 weeks on the Game Centred Approach. This approach taps on inquiry, through the use of questions to allow students to take charge of their own learning. The approach was carried out over 10 lessons, with Dr. Mitchell teaching the first class of each lesson cycle before the respective teachers made modifications to the lesson for their respective classes. The collaboration involving Dr. Mitchell culminated in a demonstration class for 20 teachers and officers from PESTA and PSOEB. The team of teachers at PGVPS then presented their two part collaboration at the 2020 Physical and Sports Education Virtual Conference.

**Physical Health & Fitness**

  

Physical health and fitness stimulate students’ interest in physical activity as meaningful connections between health concepts and practical applications are made through experiential learning.  Younger learners gain an understanding of good health practices in nutrition, exercise, safety and hygiene, as they are put through regular and purposeful health-enhancing physical activities and learning tasks. These activities generate fun and promote a positive attitude towards continual participation in physical activities for health, fitness and enjoyment.

The key focus of the Physical Health and Fitness content is to provide students with the knowledge, skills and values to empower them to make responsible decisions to pursue life-long total well-being. It also aims to provide students with the opportunities to develop and practise good health habits and attitudes through a variety of fun learning experiences presented during PE lessons.

The content for this component has been organised into five main themes:                 

·          Growth and Health

·          Good Health Habits

·          Vision and Oral Care

·          Safety First

·          Keeping Safe from Illnesses and Diseases



#### Programmes

**Health Promoting School Canteen**

The Health Promoting School Canteen Programme (HPSC) serves to bring Healthy Set Meals to students. This programme follows the existing Healthy Eating in School Programme (HESP) which introduces 10 food service guidelines in the school canteens.

The Healthy Set Meals incorporate the appropriate proportions of food from four main food groups rice and alternatives, meat and alternatives, fruit and vegetables based on Singapore’s Dietary Guidelines for Children and Adolescents ensuring that when students consume meals at the school, they will receive the right nutrients necessary for their growing needs. Each canteen stall serves at least two types of set meals per day and vendors are encouraged to change their menu daily to ensure variety.

  

  

**iCARE ( i C an be an A ctive student by exe R cising regularly and E ating wisely)**

  

The iCARE programme is developed to focus on our students’ overall physical well-being by encouraging them to develop healthy habits, using a combination of fun ways to exercise, learn about nutrition and recognising and changing behavioural habits. Parents, child and teacher work in partnership to promote healthy eating and working towards an active lifestyle  

  

  

**Health Promotion Month**

Health Promotion Month Celebrating Physically Robust Students who Eat Wisely and Exercise Regularly – A Health Promotion Effort in Punggol View

The Physical Education Department carries out an array of learning experiences for a month long annually to help our students acquire knowledge, skills and values to empower them to lead healthy lifestyles and take responsibility for their health. We hope to create a nurturing and learning environment for our students to develop positive attitudes and practise healthy habits.
