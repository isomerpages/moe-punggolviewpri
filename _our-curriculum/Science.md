<h4><strong>Our Curricular/Science</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Curricular Goal</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>A Reflective Science Inquirer</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Our Aims</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>To provide our students with experiences which stimulate their curiosity
about their physical environment.</p>
<p>To provide our students with basic scientific terms and concepts to help
them understand themselves and the world around them.</p>
<p>To provide our students with opportunities to demonstrate ways of thinking
and doing,&nbsp; and relating science to their daily lives and the society.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Programmes</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Provision of Quality Learning Experiences for Our Students</p>
<p><u>Our belief</u> 
<br>“I hear, I forget,
<br>I see, I remember,
<br>I do, I understand”
<br>- Confucius</p>
<p>The science curriculum was updated in 2023. The science curricular framework
advocates students as inquirers and teachers as facilitators. We support
our students in their learning of Science using the integrated suite of
resources&nbsp;from MOE, supplemented by resources curated by the science
teachers.</p>
<p>Our students engage in learning experiences to explore scientific concepts
actively. As they collaborate to carry out the activities, they discuss
and explain&nbsp;the observations, which further develop their conceptual
understanding of the concepts. The students then extend their learning
by applying the concepts into their daily lives or new contexts.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Happy Hall</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy Hall sessions allow teachers to engage students to apply science
in their daily life. During these sessions, science teachers share Just-In-Time
scientific phenomena or discoveries with the students. The sessions serve
as a platform to engage students in science beyond their classrooms.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Earth Week and Green Initiatives across PGVP</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Earth Week encompasses many activities that take place during assembly
and recesses. These activities allow students to understand their roles
in sustainability – protecting the Earth and conserving precious resources,
and appreciate the environment that they live in.</p>
<p>Our students and staff participate in year-long sustained efforts in recycling.
Green Leaders are trained to carry out the recycling programme in school.
Green Leaders are also given opportunities to participate in external competitions
or programmes organised by environmental agencies.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Eco-stewardship @ PGVP</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Aligned with the national sustainability agenda under the Singapore Green
Plan 2030, MOE has worked with schools to promote sustainable living, empower
students to play their part for the environment, and strengthen our green
efforts through the establishment of Eco-stewardship Programme (ESP) in
schools. Eco-stewardship @ PGVP ensures that environmental education and
sustainability practices are pervasive throughout different aspects of
school, beyond the learning of science.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>E2K (Science)</strong></h4>
