<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>PGVP CCE Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework&nbsp;
(Figure 1).&nbsp; The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big
ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices, and focused on developing
a sense of purpose in our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It involves the teaching and learning of core values, social-emotional
competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing
a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied
in the following content areas:&nbsp; National Education, Sexuality Education,
Mental Health, Education and Career Guidance, Cyber Wellness, and Family
Education.</p>

<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p>We adopt a whole school approach to broaden and deepen students’ experiences
in character and citizenship education. There are several learning platforms
where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE and FTGP lessons
during curriculum time, key student development experiences beyond the
classroom, school-based initiatives, teachable moments during subject lessons
and learning opportunities beyond the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In line with the 6 MESCAP Student Outcomes, our CCE programmes are anchored
towards nurturing our students holistically to become persons of character
who are good and useful citizens of tomorrow. This is reinforced through
the emphasis on the culture of care, strong teacher-student relationship
and close parent-school engagement.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Student Development Experiences</strong></h4>
<p>Student development experiences (SDEs) are programmes and activities that
contribute towards the holistic development of our students in the physical,
aesthetic, intellectual, moral and social domains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are highlights of our students’ experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>LOVE@PGVP</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>LOVE (Living Our Values Everyday)@PGVP is a signature programme that aims
to affirm our students for doing the right thing and to inspire others
to continue to give of their best. The programme acknowledges students
who exemplify the R³ICH values by awarding them value badges.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to learn and demonstrate the school values via
a set of observable behaviours for each value stated in the Values Booklet.&nbsp;
Teachers will then nominate these students to receive a value badge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narratives of notable local and international “heroes or heroines” who
had demonstrated these values, are taught as moral exemplars. The lessons
are taught during CCE Lessons to provide concrete role models whom the
students can learn from.&nbsp; By so doing, we hope that the students will
live out the values every day.</p>
<p>To raise awareness on the featured school value, an interactive assembly
programme was conducted. The programmes includes a skit presentation by
our teachers and students. Students reflected on the message delivered
at the Assembly talks by completing a self-reflection of their behaviour
in the Values Booklet. This message will be further reinforced during Form
Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE lessons.</p>
