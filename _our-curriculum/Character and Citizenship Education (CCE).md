<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>PGVP CCE Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework&nbsp;
(Figure 1).&nbsp; The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big
ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices, and focused on developing
a sense of purpose in our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It involves the teaching and learning of core values, social-emotional
competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing
a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied
in the following content areas:&nbsp; National Education, Sexuality Education,
Mental Health, Education and Career Guidance, Cyber Wellness, and Family
Education.</p>

<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p>We adopt a whole school approach to broaden and deepen students’ experiences
in character and citizenship education. There are several learning platforms
where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE and FTGP lessons
during curriculum time, key student development experiences beyond the
classroom, school-based initiatives, teachable moments during subject lessons
and learning opportunities beyond the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In line with the 6 MESCAP Student Outcomes, our CCE programmes are anchored
towards nurturing our students holistically to become persons of character
who are good and useful citizens of tomorrow. This is reinforced through
the emphasis on the culture of care, strong teacher-student relationship
and close parent-school engagement.</p>
