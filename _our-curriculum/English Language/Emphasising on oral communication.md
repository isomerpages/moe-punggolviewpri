### **i)&nbsp;Speaking – Show &amp; Tell**

Students prepare a short presentation for their classmates on a favourite character of their choice from the big books they read in class. &nbsp;They are given feedback based on four criteria, namely, the content shared, their body posture and eye contact with the audience, their clarity of speech as well as on how audible they were to the audience.

### **ii)&nbsp;Speech &amp; Drama**

As part of our PAL programme, all our P1 students will be exposed to Process Drama. Students are given the opportunity to discover solutions on their own with the teacher withholding her own knowledge as far as possible.&nbsp;

  

What is Process Drama?

*   a carefully planned series of ‘episodes’ where students negotiate, contribute and improvise in and out of role using a song, a story, or even a picture as a starting point.&nbsp;
*   a structured problem-solving experience&nbsp;
*   an opportunity for students to try out and rehearse scenarios in which moral and values are tested

**Engaging in meaningful learning experiences to promote language learning**

To date, our students have had a hand at making their own sandwiches, visiting the Eco-Lake at the Singapore Botanical Gardens where they learnt more about animals and insect that can be found living in or around the lake, had an ice-cream party and most recently visited the Singapore Zoo. These learning journeys provide our students with a rich learning experience that is linked to the Big Book that has been read during our Shared Reading. The shared experience provides our students with the context as well as the content to think and talk about using the target language structures and vocabulary that they have been exposed to in class.

  

After the shared experience, teachers will, with our students’ input, come up with a piece of class writing. This will lead to group writing and finally individual writing. The whole process is scaffolded so that our students will experience success.

**Shared Writing Experiences**

After reading “The Giant’s Ice-Cream”, students attended an ice-cream party and then they wrote a class story about their experience at the party.&nbsp;

**Reporting on Students’ learning and development**

During our 3-Directional Dialogue with parents in Term 1, we shared with them the learning progress of their children and after that; we gave parents the opportunity to see for themselves what their children have been learning in school. Each student was given the opportunity to demonstrate how well he or she is reading to their parents. Our students were given the choice of selecting a favourite big book of their choice to read aloud to their parents. &nbsp;By demonstrating the learned skill, parents could see how well their children had mastered the skill of reading with accuracy, expression and fluency.

  

For our 3-D dialogue in Term 4, parents will be in for a treat when they attend our “Writer’s Tea” where our students will be compiling some of their favourite pieces of writing into a book and dedicating it to their parents.&nbsp;

**Building a strong foundation for all**

Literacy strategies, such as phonemic awareness, are taught to our Primary One pupils in the Learning Support Programme (LSP). LSP is an early intervention effort for those with weak oral and reading skills in the English Language. LSP is conducted in 30-minute sessions daily for students in the programme. The additional support is part of the levelling up efforts to help our students succeed. It is conducted in a small group setting by trained Learning Support Coordinators and provides ample opportunities for students to interact in a safe learning environment.
