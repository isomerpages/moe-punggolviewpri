<p>In Punggol View Primary School, we remain focused on developing the whole
child, aiming to mold our students into Confident learners and Active citizens
with the appropriate traits and Learning Dispositions. To nurture our students
into confident learners and active citizens, we believe that our children
must be taught not only what to think but “how” to think. We want them
to be developed into Effective and Empathetic Communicators and have the
capacity to think well, think clearly and think creatively. This will ensure
they are well-equipped to navigate the complexities of the modern world.</p>
<p>The school is committed to prepare our students to be Future Ready by
employing our innovative ABC2D approach. This approach encapsulates Assessment
Literacy, Blended Learning, Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT), Effective
and Empathetic Communication to cater to the 21st Century Competencies,
and Differentiation in the classroom to ensure no child is left behind.
This comprehensive strategy ensures that every student is included and
catered to, fostering critical, inventive skills. Students also need to
embrace adaptive thinking, sizing up unexpected situations, considering
possible options and deciding on the best solution. Therefore, the school
not only focuses on academic prowess but also prepares students to adapt
and respond to unforeseen challenges effectively.</p>
<p>Punggol View Primary School actively creates various learning opportunities,
extending education beyond the conventional classroom environment. Looking
forward, the school aims to reinforce the idea of "the World as our school"
for both students and teachers. This is achieved by increasing exposure
to diverse learning platforms beyond the school's boundaries, thus broadening
the educational experience and preparing students for global challenges
and opportunities.</p>
