I am honoured to be part of the Punggol View family and to serve as the Principal of Punggol View Primary School â€“ a school that strives to develop our students into Confident Learners, Active Citizens.  

Under the stewardship of the founding principal, Mr Kelvin Tay, PGVP has progressed steadily in nurturing students into children who are healthy, joyful and anchored in our school values. I look forward to continuing the good work that has been put in place by him.  Let me take this opportunity to introduce myself.
