I am honoured to be part of the Punggol View family and to serve as the Principal of Punggol View Primary School – a school that strives to develop our students into Confident Learners, Active Citizens.  

Under the stewardship of the founding principal, Mr Kelvin Tay, PGVP has progressed steadily in nurturing students into children who are healthy, joyful and anchored in our school values. I look forward to continuing the good work that has been put in place by him.  Let me take this opportunity to introduce myself.

Prior to assuming the role of Principal in PGVP on 15 Dec 2017, I was the Principal of Fengshan Primary School. I began my career in education at St. Patrick’s school, moved on to head the Science Department in Dunman Secondary school in 2002 and served as its Vice Principal from 2007 to 2009.  A firm believer of lifelong learning, I pursued Master In Education programme with University of Western Australia in 2005 and subsequently embarking on my PhD studies with University of Leicester in 2009. Both these studies were done part time while holding on to the leadership position.  I strongly believe the challenge of balancing work and studies has made me a stronger and perhaps more understanding leader. 

I am delighted to have the opportunity of working with the PGVP staff and parents to provide a strong values-based, holistic education for every child in Punggol View Primary. To me, every child is special and very precious. As encapsulated in the Starfish story, we want to bring out the best in every child, each according to his/her strength, talent and ability. As we strive to realize this shared vision, we know the success of this endeavour is only possible through the commitment and collaborative efforts of our students, staff, parents and partners. 

I look forward to working alongside all of you to bring out the best in our students and to take PGVP to the next level.

It is indeed a privilege to be a part of the Punggol View family. Punggol View prides itself in providing a rich learning environment for our students to develop to their fullest potential. It is every educator's hope to be able to help our students achieve success based on his/her own strengths. I also believe that we must have passion for things that we do as this will see us through challenging times and will eventually lead us to excellence.

I have a passion for History and Literature and graduated with BA(Hons). I have taught for about 21 years and was HOD ICT in my former school, Junyuan Primary School, since 2010. I was given the opportunity through the MOE Post-Graduate award to pursue my Master and in 2017, I took a year off to complete my Master in Curriculum and Teaching.

Learning never stops. I would want every PGVP student to continue to pursue their dreams and work hard towards it. There is no shortcut to success. Every hardwork put in will be worth the effort. But above all these, I firmly believe that having sound moral values are very important and that one must always be first in character. I'm proud to be able to join a team of passionate staff here in PGVP who is committed to grow every student into a Confident Learner and an Active Citizen.

I found inspiration in The Starfish Story - a tale narrating a young person throwing stranded starfish back into the ocean, making a positive impact one starfish at a time. It is indeed a privilege to be in the position to shape young minds and contribute towards creating an enriching learning experience for every child in Punggol View Primary School.

Having previously served in Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) as a Year Head and HOD of English Language and Literature, I bring my own experience in both student development and curriculum. My journey in education has been shaped by a deep commitment to holistic education and a focus on creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment. I am excited to collaborate with my dedicated colleagues, esteemed parents and valued stakeholders to continue building an educational experience that prepares our students for a bright and promising future.

My passion lies in creating a school culture where every child feels seen, heard and valued. With a Master’s in Counselling from Monash University, I am dedicated to nurturing not only academic success but also the social and emotional well-being of our students. I firmly believe that a positive school experience encompasses not only rigorous academic pursuits but also the development of essential life skills and a strong sense of community.

I look forward to meeting and partnering with all of you to ensure that Punggol View Primary School continues to be a place where education goes beyond the classroom, fostering a passion for lifelong learning and personal growth.

I am very grateful to be posted to Punggol View Primary School to serve as its Vice-Principal. When I first stepped in the school campus, I could sense the strong collegiality and congeniality among the staff, and discerned how our students take great pride in all their learning endeavors.&nbsp; This resonates very well in the school’s vision of ‘Confident Learners, Active Citizens’. I am also very delighted to sense the school’s concerted approach in providing a holistic education for all students, with a strong emphasis on character development.

I started my teaching career by spending 18 years at Blangah Rise Primary School, having served as its Head of Department for ICT and Vice-Principal before being rotated to Zhonghua Primary School for another 6 years.&nbsp; A firm believer in innovation, I have always been championing this cause with my colleagues, resulting in enhanced student learning, improved work processes and reduced workload without comprising learning rigour or desired outcomes.

My training in Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) with a specialization in Management at NUS has helped a lot in my role as a school administrator. I was heartened to be conferred both the Dr Ruth Wong Medal and Association of Curriculum &amp; Supervision Development (ASCD) Book Prize when I pursued my Diploma in Departmental Management (DDM). My RECSAM (Regional Education Centre in Science &amp; Mathematics) scholarship to Penang in learning action research and my Master of Music Education Degree at NIE had further deepened my curriculum knowledge, which I am hopeful that I am able to spread the seed of knowledge with all my colleagues at PGVP joyfully while learning from them concurrently as we advance the Learn for Life movement together. I look forward to working with all to help our students become future-ready lifelong learners.

I am excited to be a part of Punggol View Primary - a learning environment that is vibrant and exciting.&nbsp; I joined the education service in 1996 as a teacher at Red Swastika School.&nbsp; Subsequently, I served as the HOD Science in the school before being appointed as Vice Principal in Ai Tong School, followed by postings to Park View Primary School and Casuarina Primary School.&nbsp; This year, I have been posted to Punggol View as the Vice Principal (Admin).&nbsp; Although this is a new learning opportunity for me, nevertheless, I hope to be able to share some of my experience gleaned over the years to enrich the staff and students at Punggol View Primary.

My educational philosophy has always been to provide students with a broad-based holistic education. Schools should equip students with the necessary life-skills and learning tools so that they are able to learn for life. With the help of our dedicated team of teachers, students should be able to pick up positive learning dispositions, values and attitudes for lifelong learning.&nbsp; As such, the educational environment, our classrooms and facilities must be able to allow teachers to impart learning and for students to become critical thinkers, self-directed learners and collaborative team members and leaders. Our school must also allocate appropriate resources to allow for teaching and learning to meet our students’ learning outcomes.&nbsp; I am very sure that, together with the vibrant team of teachers and administrators, we will work in partnership with parents and the community to create quality teaching and learning programmes for our students so as to make Punggol View Primary a choice school in Punggol in the years to come.
